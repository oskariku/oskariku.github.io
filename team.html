  <h1>Our Team</h1>
  <h3>The dream team that made this game come to life</h3>
  <p>Our team worked day and night, with the power of coffee and Snickers bars. It wasn't always easy, but we managed to put together what we think will be the game of the century. Blood, sweat and tears were shed. People lost. Good people...</p>
  <p>Anyway! Without further delay. Team 9!</p>

    <h3>Juho "<span class="dictator">The Dictator</span>" Oksa</h3>
    <p>Our mighty leader, with his loose sense of justice, pushed us forward. Even on the verge starvation we worked like Chinese children in an Apple sweatshop. He is great, tremendous leader. Best. Leader. Ever. Anyone who says something else is fake news!</p>

    <div class="essi">
      <img src="./images/essi.png" alt="Essi">
        <h3>Essi</h3>
      <p>To be honest, Essi might be the only normal one in our team. Her quick learning skills and enthustiastic attitude were truly a godsent.</p>

          <h3>Eelis Melto</h3>
          <p>We honestly have no idea who this guy is. We think he just might be some homeless hobo who wondered in. We didn't have the heart to throw him back in the streets...</p>

            <h3>Oskari Kuusela</h3>
          <p>Fierce HTML-warrior with mediocre skills in coding and incomprehensible unability to wake up early in the morning. He's stupidly handsome, though.</p>
