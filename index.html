    <h1>The story of a lone adventurer</h1>
    <h3>It is dark and dank night...</h3>
    <p>
      The sky is pitch-black. A gathering sandstorm spreads across the desert, the wind howling and throwing sand on the treasure hunterâ€™s sweaty face as he climbs up the Pyramid. He cannot see further than an inch. He pushes on, slowly advancing. The thought of the mythical treasure hidden inside gives him the strength to reach the top. He takes a crow bar out of his bag and starts to pry apart the stones blocking the entrance to the Pyramid. He succeeds, breaking his crow bar in the process. At last, he steps down into the depths of the Pyramid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The treasure hunter must survive the horrors of four different levels: the Pyramid, the Mayan Temple, the Catacombs and, finally, the Dankest Dungeon. He has to solve inconceivably difficult puzzles, collect valuable items and defeat spine-chilling enemies to obtain the treasure. As he proceeds, the treasure hunter descends from one level to the next, discovering new worlds, each being more dangerous and even more full of challenges than the previous.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>In this world mixed of fantasy and reality, the treasure hunter may encounter enemies one would find beyond belief, but the dangers of The Dankest Dungeon are all too real.</i>
