		<h1>Walkthrough</h1>
		<h3>If you get lost, don't despair! These instructions lead you away from the dankness!</h3>
		<p>In the Pyramid you, my dear treasure hunter, will have to go down the stairs, east and then down again.  These actions should be followed by a swift turn west, then a stairway down, and finally going east twice. On your way you will fight fearsome adversaries and find useful items. At the end of the Pyramid you will have to defeat the first Boss to gain access to the next level.</p>
		<p>After defeating the first Boss, you scurry down the stairs to find yourself in a completely new place. You must follow these instructions: first go south, then west, then push a mysterious button, then go north, north again, push another button, go east, east again, push the third button, go south, south again and push the final button. Finally you have to go back north and east to take a lovely golden item. Now you must go west four times, meet the second Boss and descend into the darkness yet again.</p>
		<p>Now the third level has appeared around you. In this maze you must go west, north, twice west, south and take the key pieces. Then follow these steps: go west, north, take the item, go north, west, east, east and use the anvil. To finish the level, go west, open the door, go north and beat the Boss.</p>
		<p>In the Dankest Dungeon, the final level, you’re on your own…</p>

		<h1>How it was made</h1>
		<h3>Behind the scenes</h3>
		<p>The Dankest Dungeon is a rogue-lite-like text adventure game. It draws inspiration from The Darkness Dungeon and rogue-lite and rogue-like games. The encounters with monsters and merchants as well as the item drops are randomly generated. The game is written in python and it utilizes a carefully designed SQL database. The parser of the game can understand the player’s complex text-based commands and the game code is infallible. The team created the intriguing story and the fascinating world of the game as a collaboration.</p>
